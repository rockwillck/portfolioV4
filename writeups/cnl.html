        <h2>Motivations</h2>
        <p>Crafts and Laughs is a nonprofit that donates crafts to children in hospitals. This website serves as a landing page for donations, volunteers, potential members, and potential sponsors/partners.</p>
        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>This is a completely serverless, HTML/CSS/JS site.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Finding the correct balance of interactivity and details with simplicity and accessibility was a continuous point of discussion between myself and the organization as I built the site.</p>
