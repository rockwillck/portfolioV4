		<h1>Jericho and Dwejimi</h1>
        <pre>EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
            CHILDREN huddle around a burning trash can as their MOM and DAD tell a story.
                            DAD
                Have we ever told you how our great America came to be?
                            CHILDREN
                    (in unison, excitedly)
                No! Tell us, tell us, tell us!
                            MOM
                Many years ago, before the world imploded, there was a young man named Jericho.
                            DAD
                They say he was born dead, that a goddess' touch brought him back to life. They say he was something of a god himself.
                            MOM
                Oh, but it actually begins before that, with a boy named Dwejimi. Dwejimi was a lot like Jericho, but much worse. He was angry, and insane, and a little bit evil.
                            CHILDREN
                    (quietly whimpering)
                Is this story scary, Momma?
                            MOM
                Do you wanna hear the story or not?
                            CHILDREN
                    (Small nods)
                Yes Momma, we want to hear the story!
                            MOM
                Well then. We begin in Elysia…
                        FADE OUT:
            INT. PALACE BEDROOM - DAY
            EZEKIEL lies in a bed, staring out a window. His SERVANTS stand beside him, appearing worried. The MOM stands on the side of the stage with her CHILDREN by a burning barrel, invisible to EZEKIEL and his SERVANTS.
                            EZEKIEL
                    (groaning)
                Hannah!
                            HANNAH
                    (bowing)
                Yes, my lord?
                            EZEKIEL
                Bring me a boy. Strong-willed, sturdy. Worthy of a throne.
                            HANNAH
                    (confoundedly)
                A boy, Your Majesty?
                            EZEKIEL
                    (aggravated)
                Yes, yes, a boy! Quickly, before your king wastes away!
                            HANNAH
                Yes, sire.
                            MOM
                That's right, children. King Ezekiel asked Hannah to go kidnap a child. If you don't listen to your mommy and daddy, King Ezekiel will get you too!
                            HANNAH
                    (rushing in with Dwejimi)
                A boy, my liege. The doctor says he will grow to be very strong.
                            EZEKIEL
                Be gone with you. I need to talk with this boy alone.
                            HANNAH
                    (bowing, walking away)
                Very well, my lord.
                            EZEKIEL
                    (turning to the child)
                What might be your name, young one?
                            DWEJIMI
                    (turning away nervously)
                Bomi, King Ezekiel.
                            EZEKIEL
                    (harrumphs)
                A dull name. Your name is now Dwejimi, and you are now my son.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (looking up surprisedly)
                Your son? Your honor, I have a family!
                            EZEKIEL
                Hannah! Where did you find this boy?
                            HANNAH
                At the market, my lord.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (angrily)
                You took me from my life! Return me!
                            EZEKIEL
                    (shocked)
                You would choose your family over your king? Traitorous wench!
                            DWEJIMI
                    (bowing)
                Apologies, my lord.
                            EZEKIEL
                    (deadpan)
                You will make a good king, Dwejimi. But you must learn to never apologize.
            INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
            The FISHERMAN sits in a large leather chair. A sharp knock is heard.
                            FISHERMAN
                    (startled)
                What?! Who's there?
                    (opening the door)
                Wha-
                            TILDE
                Oh the wind's frightful out here! Would you be so kind as to let a poor woman seek shelter in your home?
                            FISHERMAN
                    (lamely)
                Couch is on the left.
                    (retreats to chair)
                Don't drip on it.
                            TILDE
                    (surprised, muttering)
                This one's different. They're usually so rude!
                            FISHERMAN
                    (shouting)
                Close the door, daft idiot! It's getting cold!
                            TILDE
                And… there it is.
                        FADE OUT:
            INT. BATHROOM - DAY
            TILDE lies in a bathtub across from a mirror with the FISHERMAN and the DOCTOR.
                            TILDE
                    (groaning)
                The baby's coming!
                            FISHERMAN
                You're okay. You're okay.
                    (Turns to mirror)
                You're going to be okay.
                            TILDE
                    (screaming)
                Why'd I choose a natural birth?
                            DOCTOR
                    (holding newborn baby)
                He's come way too early.
                    (sighing, disappointed)
                He's stillborn.
                            TILDE
                    (weakly)
                I can help… bring my baby to me…
                    (strokes the baby's head)
                Return to me, my child.
                            BABY
                    (cooing)
                Baba.
                            DOCTOR
                    (fearfully)
                How? This is the work of witches!
                            TILDE
                    (disgustedly)
                I am not a witch. I am a god!
                    (falls unconscious)
                Ugh.
                        FADE OUT:
            EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY
            DWEJIMI stands in front of smoking rubble, his armor bloody and damaged. His AIDE approaches him with a grim look on their face.
                            AIDE
                Apologies, my lord. There's nothing more to be done. Elysia has fallen.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (throws his helmet to the ground)
                Curse the gods!
                            AIDE
                    (backing away)
                I- I apologize, Your Majesty.
                            DWEJIMI
                Order the men to mount up. We're defending what little we have, if nothing else.
                            AIDE
                Yes, my lord.
                            GENERAL
                    (Rushes in from left stage)
                The army is ready, my lord. But is this truly the fate you wish to doom us to?
                            DWEJIMI
                    (angrily)
                For what land will we live if not for Elysia? Who will you live for if not your king?
                            GENERAL
                    (pleading)
                We live for our homes - our lives, our wives - my king! We would kill for you, but we beg you, do not make us die for you.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (coldly)
                You will fight, General, or it will be your wife's head on the ground, not yours.
                            GENERAL
                    (angrily)
                You threaten my wife?! You may be a king, but you are a king of ruins!
                    (gesturing with arms)
                Of nothing! I should cut you down here and now!
                            DWEJIMI
                    (soft, quiet, dangerous voice)
                Lay a hand on your blade, and you will learn exactly what makes me king. Go home. I'll lead the men myself.
                            GENERAL
                    (turning around, restrained)
                Yes, my lord.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (Smiling slightly)
                Oh, and General? I apologize for the mess.
                            GENERAL
                    (surprised)
                Wha-
                        FADE OUT:
            EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY
            DWEJIMI stands above the GENERAL's corpse.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (sobbing)
                What gods have I angered? Why am I doomed to fall to mere barbarians...
                    (trailing off)
                What gods...
                            AIDE
                    (approaching quietly)
                My king, they request a meeting.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (screaming)
                Tell them they can have it all. There's nothing left worth fighting for anyway.
                            AIDE
                They want to end this war, sir.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (indignant)
                Tribute? They dare demand a tribute? I am a king! I will not bow...
                    (calms himself)
                Take the deal. Before I go mad.
                            AIDE
                Right away, my liege. You have saved Elysia.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (laughing dryly)
                Elysia died with my father.
                            AIDE
                You have saved us.
                            DWEJIMI
                What a pitiful king I am, consoled by mere house servants.
                            AIDE
                    (sighing)
                You still have our thanks, my king.

            EXT. ROAD - DAY
            JERICHO mounts a horse, TILDE and the FISHERMAN tearfully watching.
                            TILDE
                Good fare, my son.
                            FISHERMAN
                Be careful boy. A kingdom is not worth your life.
                            JERICHO
                But it is, father. What am I if not a king? A divine son without a throne is a farmer without his fields!
                            FISHERMAN
                But a farmer alive with no crops is happier than a farmer dead in the ground.
                            JERICHO
                Is he? Or is he so miserable he would take his own life?
                        FADE OUT:
            EXT. FIELD - DAY
            JERICHO stands opposite a ginormous MEERKAT that towers over him.
                            JERICHO
                Let me pass, animal menace. I am Jericho, hero of...
                            MEERKAT
                    (patronizing)
                Ah, another hero. What foolish honorable mission are you on?
                            JERICHO
                I seek to rule my own kingdom. I dream of a kingdom where men share in camaraderie, where an animal like you and a hero like I can live together, in peace!
                            MEERKAT
                    (incredulous)
                An animal?! Is that how you see me? How you all see me? I am more refined, more sophisticated, than any...
                    (sneering)
                human will ever be! I have existed for millennia, and will exist for millennia!
                    (shouting)
                You puny beings live half a century and call yourselves wise! You build your little stone rectangles and call them palaces! You wield heavy chunks of metal and call them weapons!
                    (bellowing)
                I exist in a plane so above you cannot begin to comprehend it! I- to you, I am a god!
                            JERICHO
                You're right, great meerkat. I only meant to analogize, not to offend. But for all your years, I wager that I can still beat you in any game of logic!
                            MEERKAT
                    (jeering)
                Is that so? Then riddle me this, fair hero: what frightens an elephant, but not a bird? Answer this, and I shall let you pass.
                            JERICHO
                You ask for an answer, but the one I give will not please you. The answer is not a mouse, as you postulate, but in fact a bug!
                            MEERKAT
                    (stalwart)
                Explain.
                            JERICHO
                It is but a myth that a mouse scares an elephant, for a quick movement from a small thing startles all, even something as giant as an elephant. But take, for example, a honey bee. A bird will happily eat such a pest, but an elephant will run and trumpet!
                            MEERKAT
                    (nodding)
                An interesting take, little human. You may pass.
                            JERICHO
                    (walking past)
                Come visit sometime. You'd like it in my kingdom.
                            MEERKAT
                I'll visit when you actually have a kingdom.

                Halt! Hand over your gold, traveler.
                            JERICHO
                I have no will to give it, nor it to give.
                            ASSASSIN
                Then a blood tax. Raise your arms!
                            JERICHO
                    (raising his arms)
                Why?
                            ASSASSIN
                    (exasperated)
                Every time...
                    (mumbling and holding his head)
                every time…
                    (shouting)
                I meant your sword, fool, your sword!
                            JERICHO
                    (sneaking behind the assassin)
                Fool, you say?
                            ASSASSIN
                    (posing)
                Crafty… parley!
                            JERICHO
                    (aggressively stabbing)
                What tomfoolery is that stance?
                            ASSASSIN
                    (panting, coughing up blood)
                Well played, fool, well played.

                This feels oddly twisted…
                            OLD MAN
                    (menacing)
                Die, cream-faced loon!
                            JERICHO
                Nevermind.
                            OLD MAN

            DWEJIMI lies on the floor in front of his throne. His AIDE rushes in with a COURIER.
                            AIDE
                Sire, there's a courier here. He brings news of a new kingdom in the West!
                            DWEJIMI
                    (leaping to his feet)
                What man dares rule where my kingdom stood?!
                            COURIER
                Jericho MacIntyre hereby declares the founding of the kingdom of Pidyndale.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (yelling angrily)
                HANNAH! Get the troops ready! We're going on a crusade!
                            AIDE
                My name's not…
                    (shaking head)
                nevermind. Yes, immediately, my lord. And of the barbarians?
                            DWEJIMI
                Curse them! We'll cut a path right through them if we have to. Just ready the troops!
                            AIDE
                    (whimpering)
                Yes, sire.
                            DWEJIMI
                And get me some candied figs!
            EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY
            DWEJIMI and his ARMY stand opposite the BARBARIAN KING and the BARBARIAN ARMY.
                            BARBARIAN KING
                Where do you think you're going, little king?
                            DWEJIMI
                We wish you no harm, barbarian. We simply have business to attend to at the remains of Elysia.
                            BARBARIAN KING
                No one crosses the border. Not even you, illiterate, pitiable wench.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (gritting teeth)
                It's urgent business. We will return. The tithe will be paid in full. Let us pass. And I am not illiterate, you half-minded fool!
                            BARBARIAN KING
                    (stomping)
                You. Will. Not. Leave. I have spoken. Return to your palace, white one.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (indignant)
                Your forces look sick, king. Are you sure they could withstand me?
                            BARBARIAN KING
                    (enraged)
                Is that a threat?
                            DWEJIMI
                Of course not. Simply… an observation. But I would suggest you send some of your troops home. They look… weak.
                            BARBARIAN KING
                    (sighing)
                My army is ailing.
                    (resolute)
                But it will never - never! - fall to yours.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (guffawing)
                This is not your choice. Let us pass.
                            BARBARIAN KING
                No. This is your final warning. Go. Home.
                            DWEJIMI
                    (turning to army)
                You heard the man. Let's go home. Let's go to our ancestral Elysia!

                We have failed you.. my lord.

                Onward, to Elysia!
            EXT. PIDYNDALE - DUSK
            DWEJIMI sits on a horse on the opposite side of an opaque wall as JERICHO, also on a horse. DWEJIMI's ARMY stands behind him.

                    (sing-song)
                Open the gates, Jericho. I have an army, and you have but a mare.
                            JERICHO
                    (calmly)
                An army, you say? Well, I have the power of the divine.
                            DWEJIMI
                I believe I can beat a man. Blast the gods, they can kill me after. Release the balls!
            Balls roll into the wall, and sections collapse.
                            DWEJIMI
                Ready to surrender yet?
                            JERICHO
                Hardly! As you said, I have but a mare and my own life, and that cannot be threatened by these balls of stone.
                            DWEJIMI
                Balls of stone, indeed!
                            JERICHO
                Balls of stone? Nay. There is something I await. I will not lose today.

                Patience, Chikim.
                    (looks up, looks down)
                you hardly have any place to be anyways.

                Well, it means you're
                    (inhales deeply)
                disorganized, messy, unemployed, disheveled, lazy, worthless, disappointing...
                            CHIKIM
                Yes, yes, I get it, I'm awesome. What did you want to show me?
                            CHIKIM'S MOM
                Oh, yes, I wanted to give you this.
                    (pulls out a broken half of a sword)
                It's a sword, a gift from your good-for-nothing father.

                Just, get out of here. He needs help. I heard his girly screams last night.
                            CHIKIM
                Where is he?
                            CHIKIM'S MOM
                How would I know? He's probably somewhere in the middle of nowhere, cock fighting with some drunk ogre and calling it conquering the world!
                            CHIKIM
                Ah, so he's in Elysia.

                    (resolute)
                Then I'd rather die.

                it might as well be, with how heroic I'm being.

                I would kill you, but you have people to tend to.
                    (thinks)
                But a tithe must be paid. Your leg it is.

                You righteous maniac! Have your kingdom, have it! I don't want it anymore! But remember this - I let you have it! You did. Not. Win!
                        FADE TO BLACK:
            EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
            CHILDREN huddle around a burning trash can as their MOM and DAD tell a story.
                            CHILDREN
                Then Mama, why are we like this now?
                            MOM
                Well, Jericho died.
                            CHILDREN
                So then… when Dad dies, we'll all die too? Because you and Dad always say we're your whole world!
                            MOM
                    (cooing)
                Aww… that's so sweet!
                            DAD
                    (choking)
                Caroline! Help!
                            MOM
                    (annoyed)
                That's not funny, Max. Stop it!
                            DAD
                    (collapses on the floor, spasms)
                Eugh!
                            MOM
                    (poking the father with a stick)
                Yeah, he's dead. I wonder why…
                    (picks up plate)
                Children, where did you get this meat?
                            CHILDREN
                The sewers, Mama, just like you said!
                            MOM
                I said the shopping mall!
                            CHILDREN
                Fuck.
