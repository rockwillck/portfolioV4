		<h1>SmilesDB</h1>
        <p>A SMILES-first molecular database</p>
        <a href="https://smilesdb.org">smilesdb.org</a>
        <img class="preview" src="../assets/imgs/sdb.png">
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>SmilesDB is a product of need - while working on a research program at the Wolfram Emerging Leaders Program, I found that there were no readily accessible online SMILES databases.</p>
        <p>There were, of course, databases with SMILES strings, but it was difficult to query these in large quantities (quickly).</p>
        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>SmilesDB runs on <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a> servers and is written on the Flask microframework. Web scraping was done in advance and used BeautifulSoup4 and Javascript snippets injected into downloaded HTML.</p>
        <p>The API is <a href="https://smilesdb.org/docs">documented</a> and open source.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>The initial scraping was a challenge, as I sourced molecules from BindingDB - a site that uses dynamic loading for its tables. The ultimate solution involved javascript injected into the page.</p>
